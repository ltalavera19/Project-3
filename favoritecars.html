<h1>My Favorite Cars</h1>
<h4>2019 Volkswagen Golf R</h4>

<p>The all-wheel-drive Golf R is motivated by a potent turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four—making 
    288 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque—mated to either a six-speed manual or a seven-speed 
    dual-clutch automatic transmission. (Car and Driver)</p>

<h4>2022 Mini Cooper John Cooper Works</h4>

<p>The 2022 Mini Cooper John Cooper Works Hardtop arrives on the scene with fresh styling influenced 
    by the changes made to the regular vehicle, but also includes some bespoke upgrades. A larger front 
    grille and better cooling ducts enhance performance, as does an optional adaptive suspension system. 
    This is complemented by a redesigned rear diffuser, but no more power is extracted from the 
    2.0-liter turbo-four. You still get 228 horsepower and the ability to hit 60 mph in six seconds, 
    but now you can do it in a choice of two new colors as well. (CarBuzz) </p>

<h4>2021 Audi RS7</h4>

<p>The 2022 Audi RS7 is a super-high-performance hatchback that's as audacious as it is luxurious.
    Still, with haunches this broad and a twin-turbo V-8 boasting 591 horsepower, getting noticed and 
    going fast are the RS7's primary objectives. (Car and Driver)</p>

<h4>2022 Jaguar F-Pace SVR</h4>
    <img src="images/jagsvr.jpg" alt="2022 Jaguar F-Pace SVR">
<p>Strikingly styled and perfectly posh, the 2022 Jaguar F-Pace SVR stands out in its class of 
    compact-luxury SUVs for its beauty. But its party trick is its 550-hp V-8 and roaring exhaust note. 
    While other performance-oriented SUVs such as the Porsche Macan GTS and the BMW X3 M offer even 
    sharper, more focused driving dynamics to accompany their souped-up engines, the F-Pace SVR has a 
    softer bearing which makes it more agreeable as a daily driver. The trade off, of course, is that 
    the Jag's handling isn't as thrilling as several of its rivals. Inside this British confection the 
    cabin is fit for a Royal, with fine materials including gorgeous quilted leather upholstery and a 
    host of tech features featuring a large 11.4-inch infotainment touchscreen and an 11-speaker Meridian 
    stereo system. (Car and Driver)</p>
